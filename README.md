# Packet Tracer Network

## Project Overview

A simple network demonstrating a basic network with three PCs connected to a switch with a router connected to the switch. The router will function as a dhcp server with a pool of ip addresses to hand out to the PCs.

#Project Objective

Configure a simple three PC network with a connected switch and router and then have each PC ping each other to verify connectivity.

Project Steps 

<br> Step 1: Place three PCs, a switch and a router and connect all devices with appropriate network cables <br>

<br> Step 3: Configure connected router with DHCP settings including: <br>
<br> -Excluded addresses, Pool name, Default router <br> 
<br> -DNS-Server, TFTP Server, Full DHCP Network Pool <br>
